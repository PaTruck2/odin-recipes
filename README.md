# odin-recipes
<!-- My first official web page with the odin project.The project was to make a webpage showcasing three different recipes of my choice. I was required to show a picture of the final item, list the ingredients and step needed to make the food. Some of the issues are ran into were command line related. Firstly I was trying to commit my project as I went on. The issue was that I tried to do it from memory before I looked back at the previous lessons, I wasn't sure how to add and commit my project in addition to adding a comment. As I tried many variations of I how THOUGHT it was done I finally figured it out for myself and after committing a few times this project, the task became easier and easier. In the long run this project was a great way to test my knowledge so far into the course. I learned a lot, figured out a lot.>
