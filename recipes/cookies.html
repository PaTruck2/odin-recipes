        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Crispy around the edges, chewy and chocolaty in the middle, and thin, 
            oh so thin. My 'secret' formula has been adapted from Alton Brown's 
            famous, 'The Thin' recipe, and is fairly foolproof. The only real 
            variable is the baking time, since we all scoop slightly different 
            amounts. And yes, of course you can add nuts to yours!
